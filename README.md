# expression-traversal

## Intro

This repository provides a robust and generalized solution to a problem inspired by an assignment of
narrower scope I completed for a CS class.

The generalized problem is given a collection of operands and set of binary operators, determine all permutations of operator-operand expressions
that result in a desired result with each operand being used only once.

I had not taken a data structures course at this point, so I knew vaguely of tree-like data structures. My working through the problem
without guidance led me to a solution similar but not identical to a binary expression tree. 

The reason for the publication is mainly to demonstrate my problem solving skills as well as knowledge of concepts such as recursion,
data structures, robust, generalized code
